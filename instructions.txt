2. React: Kanban Board

Kanban is a popular workflow used in task management, project management, issue tracking, and other similar purposes. The workflow is usually visualized using a Kanban Board.

Create a Kanban Board component with tasks, where each task consists of a name only, as shown below:

The component must have the following functionalities:

•	The component board contains 4 stages of tasks in the sequence 'Backlog', 'To Do', 'Ongoing', and 'Done'.

•	An array of tasks is passed as a prop to the component.

•	In every individual stage, the tasks are rendered as a list <ul>, where each task is a single list item <li> that displays the name of the task.

•	Each task list item has 2 icon buttons on the right:

1.	Back button: This moves the task to the previous stage in the sequence, if any. This button is disabled if the task is in the first stage.

2.	Forward button: This moves the task to the next stage in the sequence, if any. This button is disabled if the task is in the last stage.

• Each task has 2 properties:

° name: The name of task. This is the unique identification for every task. [STRING]

° stage: The stage of the task. [NUMBER] (0 represents the 'Backlog' stage. 1 represents the 'To Do' stage, 2 represents the 'Ongoing' stage, and 3 represents the 'Done' stage)

The following data-testid attributes are required in the component for the tests to pass:
•	The <ul> for the 'Backlog' stage should have the data-testid attribute 'stage-0'.
•	The <ul> for the To Do' stage should have the data-testid attribute 'stage-1 '.
•	The <ul> for the 'Ongoing' stage should have the data-testid attribute 'stage-2'.
•	The <ul> for the 'Done' stage should have the data-testid attribute 'stage-3'.

•	Every <li> task should follow these guidelines:

1.	The <span> containing the name should have the data-testid attribute 'TASK_N AM E-name', where TASK_NAME is the name of the task joined by a hyphen symbol. 

For example, for the task named 'task O', it should be 'task-O-name'. For the task named 'abc', it should be 'abc-name'.

2.	The back button should have the data-testid attribute 'TASK_NAME-back', where TASK_NAME is the name of the task joined by a hyphen symbol. 

For example, for the task named 'task O', it should be 'task-O-back'. For the task named 'abc', it should be 'abc-back'.

3.	The forward button should have the data-testid attribute 'TASK_NAME-forward', where TASK_NAME is the name of the task joined by a hyphen symbol. 

For example, for the task named 'task O', it should be 'task-O-forward'. For the task named 'abc', it should be 'abc- forward'.

Please note that components have the above data-testid attributes for test cases and certain classes and ids for rendering purposes. It is advised not to change them.
